title: Almost No News on the Complexity of MAP in Bayesian Networks
abstract: "This article discusses the current state of the art in terms of\r computational
  complexity for the problem of finding the most probable\r configuration of a subset
  of variables in a multivariate domain\r modelled by probabilistic graphical models
  such as Markov networks\r (random fields) or Bayesian networks. It contains complexity
  proofs and an\r algorithm for the problem and shows empirical results for Boolean\r
  trees which may suggest tractability of the task in some special\r cases."
