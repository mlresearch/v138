title: "An Efficient Low-Rank Tensors Representation for \r Algorithms in Complex
  Probabilistic Graphical Models"
abstract: "Probabilistic Graphical Models form a class of compact \r representations
  of high-dimensional probability distributions by \r decomposing these distributions
  in a set of multivariate factors \r (potentials). Every exact algorithm (for probabilistic
  inference, MAP, \r etc.) operates on a specific representation of these potentials.
  However \r complex probabilistic models often lead to very large potentials which
  \r dramatically impact both the space and time complexities of these \r algorithms
  and which can make inference in complex models intractable. \r In this paper we
  propose a new approach based on low-rank tensor \r representation to approximate
  and operate with these potentials. The \r low-rank tensor representation is used
  for the approximation of \r potentials with controlled precision and an important
  reduction in the \r number of parameters. Every operator used in such algorithms
  \r (multiplication, addition, projection, etc.) can be defined within this \r representation,
  leading to an approximation framework where every \r algorithm for PGMs can be easily
  implemented. As an instance of this \r framework, we present a classical message
  passing algorithm in Bayesian \r networks using the tensor train format. By reducing
  significantly the \r computational complexity and the memory usage, the proposed
  approach \r makes probabilistic inference much more scalable. These results are
  \r illustrated by experiments on dynamic Bayesian networks and classical \r Bayesian
  networks performed using a Python implementation with \r TensorFlow, T3F and pyAgrum."
