title: "Interactive Anomaly Detection in Mixed Tabular Data \r using Bayesian Networks"
abstract: "The last decades improvements in processing abilities \r have quickly led
  to an increasing use of data analyses implying massive \r data-sets. To retrieve
  insightful information from any data driven \r approach, a pivotal aspect to ensure
  is good data quality. Manual \r correction of massive data-sets requires tremendous
  efforts, is prone to \r errors, and results being really costly. If knowledge in
  a specific \r field can often allow the development of efficient models for anomaly
  \r detection and data correction, this knowledge can sometimes be \r unavailable
  and a more generic approach should be found. This paper \r presents a novel approach
  to anomaly detection and correction in mixed \r tabular data using Bayesian Networks.
  We present an algorithm for \r detecting anomalies and offering correction hints
  based on Jensen scores \r computed within the Markov Blankets of considered variables.
  We also \r discuss the incremental corrections of detection model using user’s \r
  feedback, as well as additional aspects related to discretization in \r mixed data
  and its effects on detection efficiency. Finally we also \r discuss how functional
  dependencies can be managed to detect errors \r while improving faithfulness and
  computation speed. "
