title: "\\textttMeDIL: A Python Package for Causal Modelling"
abstract: "  We present the \\texttt{MeDIL} Python package for causal modelling.\r
  Its current features focus on (i) non-linear unconditional pairwise independence
  testing,\r (ii) constraint-based causal structure learning, and\r (iii) learning
  the corresponding functional causal models (FCMs), all for the class of measurement
  dependence inducing latent (MeDIL) causal models.\r MeDIL causal models and therefore
  the \\texttt{MeDIL} software package are especially suited for analyzing data from
  fields such as psychometric, epidemiology, etc. that rely on questionnaire or survey
  data."
