title: "Discovering cause-effect relationships in spatial systems \r with a known
  direction based on observational data"
abstract: "Many real-world studies and experiments are \r characterized by an underlying
  spatial structure that induces \r dependencies between observations. Most existing
  causal discovery \r methods, however, rely on the IID assumption, meaning that they
  are \r ill-equipped to handle, let alone exploit this additional information. \r
  In this work, we take a typical example from the field of ecology with \r an underlying
  directional flow structure in which samples are collected \r from rivers and show
  how to adapt the well-known Fast Causal Inference \r (FCI) algorithm (Spirtes et
  al., 2000) to learn cause-effect \r relationships in such a system efficiently.
  We first evaluated our \r adaptation in a simulation study against the original
  FCI algorithm and \r found significantly increased performance regardless of the
  sample size. \r In a subsequent application to real-world river data from the US
  state \r of Ohio, we identified important likely causes of biodiversity measured
  \r in the form of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) metric."
