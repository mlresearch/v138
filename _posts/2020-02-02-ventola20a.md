title: Residual Sum-Product Networks
abstract: "Tractable yet expressive density estimators are a key \r building block
  of probabilistic machine learning. While sum-product \r networks (SPNs) offer attractive
  inference capabilities, obtaining \r structures large enough to fit complex, high-dimensional
  data has proven \r challenging. In this paper, we present a residual learning approach
  to \r ease the learning of SPNs, which are deeper and wider than those used \r previously.
  The main trick is to ensemble SPNs by explicitly \r reformulating sum nodes as residual
  functions. This adds references to \r substructures across the SPNs at different
  depths, which in turn helps \r to improve training. Our experiments demonstrate
  that the resulting \r residual SPNs (ResSPNs) are easy to optimize, gain performance
  from \r considerably increased depth and width, and are competitive to  state \r
  of-the-art SPN structure learning approaches. To combat overfitting, we \r introduce
  an iterative pruning technique that compacts models and yields \r better generalization."
